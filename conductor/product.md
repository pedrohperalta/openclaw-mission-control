# Product Definition

## Project Name

Stone AI Mission Control

## Description

Centralized operations and governance platform for running AI agents across teams.

## Problem Statement

Teams lack a unified surface to plan, execute, review, and audit AI agent work. Without Mission Control, work is split across multiple tools with no central visibility, governance, or accountability.

## Target Users

Product and engineering teams that want to focus on goals, not tasks. These teams need a single control plane where they can define objectives, delegate execution to AI agents, approve sensitive actions, and audit outcomes -- without splitting attention across scattered tooling.

## Key Goals

1. **Goal-driven work** -- Teams define objectives and success criteria; agents handle task decomposition and execution.
2. **Human-in-the-loop approvals** -- Sensitive actions are routed through explicit approval flows before execution, keeping decision trails attached to work.
3. **API-first automation** -- Every operation available in the UI is also accessible through the API, enabling automation clients and process integration.
